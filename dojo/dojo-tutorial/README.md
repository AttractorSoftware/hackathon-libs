# Dojo Toolkit 1.9 Tutorial

This is a tutorial with simple examples how to solve real life scenarios with Dojo and how to create Rich Internet Applications / Singe Page Applications mostly backend oriented.
The tutorial was started because of lack of good examples that can introduce Dojo step by step, which by far is most likely one of the most powerful and comprehensive javascript toolkits in the world offering a lot more ready to use widgets than any other popular javascript framework.
